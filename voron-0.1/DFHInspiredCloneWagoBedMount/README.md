# DeepFriedHeroin inspired clone wago v0 bed mount
I like the idea of https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/deepfriedheroin/v0_bed_wagos but sadly they didn't fit my clone wagos.

These files are a design inpired by that.

Hardware
 - M3x8 button head
 - M3 nut
 - Clone wago (13.5 x 10 x 18) as pictured

To insert the wago put the top in first and then push the bottom in, enjoy
the satifying snap and know that the only way it's coming out again is
if you break the mount.
