# Latch for panels on 1515 extrusion

This is not an original idea. For information go on history [go here](https://github.com/richardjm/voron-parts/tree/main/voron-2.4/FilamentLatch)

## Hardware
- m3x12
- Only tested against LDO extrusions, if you're using something else the pins may need to be adjusted (let me know how)

## Assembly

1. Print parts (do test prints to ensure you're happy with the fit before going wild)
1. Assemble to correct orientation
1. Insert two short filament lengths connecting middle hinge to hinge body, one from each side
1. Insert one long filament length connecting middle hinge to outer hinge
1. The filaments are a tight-ish fit on the hinge arms but loose in the pivot intentionally
1. Connect to frame using with an m3 nut or similar with an m3x12 screw
1. @Ingstronmentalist requested a handle to open the latches, so if you're having difficulty opening the latches print one of those too

## Designs
Choose a size based on your panel and foam thickness. **Always do a test print before assuming the size will work for you.**

NewLatch-v0.1-TopHat-?.?mm.stl - used for the perimiter at the top of the side panels to create clearance for the top hat

NewLatch-v0.1-TopRear-?.?mm.stl - used for the top latches on the electronics panel

NewLatch-v0.1-?.?mm.stl - used everywhere else
